Issue Summary:
On February 22, 2023, at 03:45 AM (UTC), our platform encountered a severe outage lasting 5 hours. User requests surged to 100% 500 errors at its peak, causing widespread disruptions. Investigations revealed that the root cause was a latent bug in our caching system, exacerbated by an unexpected surge in user traffic during a marketing campaign.

Timeline:

Timezone: UTC
Outage Duration: 03:45 AM to 08:45 AM
Outage Began: February 22, 2023, at 03:45 AM
Staff Notified: February 22, 2023, at 03:50 AM
Actions/Events:
1. 03:50 AM: Automated alerts triggered; on-call staff immediately engaged.
2. 04:00 AM: Initial assessment identified the caching system as a potential bottleneck.
3. 04:30 AM: Traffic spike from the marketing campaign intensified; 500 errors skyrocketed.
4. 05:15 AM: Decision to isolate the affected caching node to prevent further spread.
5. 07:30 AM: Incremental service restoration initiated.
6. 08:45 AM: Full service restoration achieved.

Root Cause:
The outage stemmed from an obscure bug in the caching algorithm, which, when subjected to an unforeseen traffic surge, triggered an unhandled exception. This exception, left unaddressed, led to a cascading failure, compromising the stability of our entire service. The surge in traffic, primarily attributed to a successful marketing campaign, exposed a vulnerability that had gone undetected in previous load testing scenarios.

Resolution and Recovery:

1. Immediate Mitigation (04:00 AM - 05:00 AM): Temporary alleviation of the issue by redirecting traffic away from the affected caching node.
2. Isolation and Investigation (05:15 AM - 06:30 AM): Identification and isolation of the problematic code, followed by a thorough investigation into the root cause.
3. Incremental Restoration (07:30 AM - 08:45 AM): Gradual reintroduction of services to ensure stability, closely monitored for any signs of regression.
4. Communications: Regular updates provided via our status page, social media, and direct emails to affected users, explaining the situation and progress made.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

1. Code Review and Hardening: Scheduled a comprehensive code review with an emphasis on caching algorithms and error handling mechanisms.
2. Automated Testing (Ongoing): Strengthened automated testing frameworks to simulate unexpected traffic spikes and identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Monitoring and Alerting: Enhanced monitoring to detect anomalies in real-time, with automated alerts configured to respond promptly.
4. Redundancy and Failover: Implemented additional caching nodes with failover mechanisms to ensure continued service availability during traffic surges.
5. Incident Response Training: Conducted an immediate review of incident response procedures and scheduled regular training sessions for the team.

What Can We Do Better Next Time?

1. Regular Drills: Instituted monthly simulation drills to better prepare the team for handling similar incidents and improve coordination.
2. Enhanced Communication: Introduced a more transparent and streamlined communication protocol, ensuring users receive timely updates during incidents.
3. User Communication Protocol: Implemented a standardized protocol for communicating with users during service disruptions, including estimated resolution times and post-incident reports.
