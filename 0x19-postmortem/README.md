## **Issue Summary**

**Duration**: The outage occurred on November 13, 2023, disrupting our Zen-like digital existence from 02:00 AM to 06:00 AM (UTC).

**Impact**: Picture this: the authentication service taking a coffee break, leaving users locked out with 503 errors. Approximately 75% of our users felt the FOMO of the century.

**Root Cause**: Our load balancer decided to showcase its interpretive dance skills, executing a flawless misconfiguration waltz, throwing the authentication servers off rhythm.

## **Timeline**

* 02:00 AM: Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in authentication errors.
* 02:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on the authentication service logs to identify any anomalies.
* 02:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue might be related to a recent deployment; investigation into recent changes initiated.
* 03:00 AM: Load balancing misconfiguration identified as the root cause; corrective measures initiated.
* 03:30 AM: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for further assistance and expertise.
* 04:00 AM: Load balancing misconfiguration rectified, and traffic distribution normalized.
* 06:00 AM: Service fully restored; monitoring in place to ensure stability; load balancer now contemplating a career in the arts.

## **Root Cause and Resolution**

**Root Cause**: Our load balancer's secret career in interpretive dance led to a mismatched choreography, causing a traffic bottleneck at the authentication servers. A classic case of a load balancer trying to be too avant-garde.

**Resolution**: The mischievous load balancer was enrolled in a crash course on proper load balancing choreography. Configuration tweaks were made, ensuring a more harmonious distribution of traffic. The load balancer now moonlights as a dance instructor.

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**

**Improvements/Fixes**:

Load Balancer Configuration Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
Automated Anomaly Detection: Enhance automated monitoring with anomaly detection to quickly identify and alert on irregularities in system behavior.

**Tasks**:

**Load Balancer Configuration Audit**: Schedule a regular audit of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
**Automated Rollback Procedures**: Implement automated rollback procedures to swiftly revert to a stable configuration in the event of issues post-deployment.

This incident taught us that sometimes, even load balancers need a little rhythm in their lives. We appreciate your patience and promise to keep the dance floor, um, servers, stable in the future!
